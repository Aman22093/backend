The camera seems okay, but the selfie does its own thing to enhance the image. In my photo I seem to have lipstick on, when I haven't.  The worst thing about this phone is that it comes with some apps you cannot remove. Moreover, everytime you update the phone, they install a host of games and apps you never asked for.

The 6.5-inch display is vibrant and clear, with a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels. The phone is easy to hold and use with one hand, and the buttons and ports are well-placed and easy to access.Performance-wise, the Redmi Note 12 5G is impressive for a budget phone. It runs on the Mediatek Dimensity 700 5G chipset, which provides excellent processing power and speed. The phone has 4GB of RAM, which is sufficient for most daily tasks, and the 128GB of storage is ample for storing all my photos, videos, and apps.I have been very impressed with the camera performance on this phone. The triple-lens setup on the back includes a 48MP primary lens, a 2MP macro lens, and a 2MP depth sensor. The photos come out clear and vibrant, with good detail and color accuracy. The front-facing camera is also good for selfies and video calls.The battery life on this phone is excellent. The 5000mAh battery easily lasts me a full day on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The phone also supports fast charging, which is a great feature to have when you're in a hurry and need to top up the battery quickly.The phone runs on MIUI 12, which is a user-friendly and customizable operating system.

Hardware wise, it can't really get any better at this price (except the 4gb ram). It is definitely one of the most 'no compromise' upper tier budget phone in the market currently. But the thing is that some of the features that made MIUI unique has been removed from the MIUI version of the note 12 (like second space, dual apps, etc. which debuted on MIUI for the first time). And I don't know if this is a feature or a bug, I simply cannot use split screen no matter what. These are just my personal feelings about this phone. I am talking about these software features because I have been using redmi phones for quite a while and I am missing those. If you can get over these things, it is one of the best phones overall at this price (the exchange offers and other discounts being the icing on the cake).","Date":" 21 February 2023","Sentiments":"Positive" }

            {"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Good camera at reasonable price","Review":"A DSLR camera is as as good as the lens it comes with. I am not a professional photographer, but someone who likes to take good pictures! The first set of pictures I have taken with this camera was on a visit to a wildlife sanctuary. While taking a shot, it appears that the object is far off, even with zoom, but once the shot is captured, the picture comes absolutely clear and perfect! However for longer shots, Obviously one has to invest in costlier and powerful DSLR lens! Lighting with or without flash is perfect. I just used AF and kept shooting and I was absolutely delighted with the product!","Date":" 12 May 2022","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Too good camera","Review":"i bought after long research, but i have a small doubt it is good or not.

I have Nikon D 800E,D810 but they have no touch screen only D850 has. Canon in this price bracket provides touch screen .Canon has a legendary auto ISO function. In RAW file It will be have no need to touch ISO SLIDER. Color rendition is superb.Canon understands the Indian complexion well.Beginners can use every possible mode to gain experience.Picture quality is extraordinary .Above all the lens is very good according to picture quality but build quality is not good with plastic mount. I used canon 350 D, 40D,50D,60D, 5D MK II but canon lenses are fungus prone the L series lenses were loaded with fungus. The cheap lenses deteriorate in image quality rapidly due to fungus infestation.Overall it\u2019s a excellent camera to begin with.The service of Amazon is exemplary .The camera came 2days before but the advertisement showed the lens was 18-55mm f\/4 I ordered it for that reason but the seller supplied me 18-55mm f \/4-5.6 .It is a sheer breach of contract.","Date":" 12 June 2020","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"1.0","Title":"Defective item","Review":"Does not working properly","Date":" 26 August 2023","Sentiments":"Neutral"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"My First DSLR","Review":"This Product is good. focus and image quality ,camera body and other. good price and good photo quality.","Date":" 24 December 2022","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Good beginners camera","Review":"Better for beginners that to learnNot that compatibility for professional propose","Date":" 6 January 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"BEST camera","Review":"it's very good product the best minimum budget DSLR camer is it,thank you amazon.","Date":" 26 December 2022","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Best for Beginners","Review":"This one is good for beginners.

Camera body autofocus is great specially in the video.  Easy to shoot cinematic videos as autofocus is too smooth. Coming to the lens it is just kit lens with aperture starting at 4, so don't expect razor-sharp image indoor. Up to 800 ISO, there is no visible noise. At 1600 ISO you will see little noise if you view in 100% the actual size of the photo. For 4x6 or 5x7 it will not noticeable. Just buy an additional lens, like 50 mm, and you will get awesome indoor and low light photos and videos. Camera is great in this price range. IF you have photographic or video graphic hobby then go for it without second thought","Date":" 8 January 2020","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"3.0","Title":"Ready to invest more in flash light if you want to take night time photos","Review":"It only supports TTL flash, which will cost around 8000+ else u need to buy a trigger which will cost around 3500","Date":" 17 June 2022","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Good quality product, but ensure good light before taking picture","Review":"Product physical quality is good...  but poor performance in insude room use...  picture quality is very poor.

I'm new to photography, so I only had the basic lens that came with my camera (Canon Rebel T5i). However, this lens exceeded my expectations. I was extremely happy with my purchase.As you can see in the photos, there is a huge difference in the quality. The first one was taken with my original lens (18-55 mm) when it was all the way zoomed in, while the second and third were taken with this lens. Huge difference! The colors are brighter, it focuses better, and the larger aperture makes a noticeable difference.As I said before, I'm new to photography so I wasn't really expecting much out of this lens. However, I think the average user would be very pleased with this, and for someone new to photography it would be a great investment to help them get started and gain confidence.-----Photo 1: ISO 100, 55 mm, f\/7.1, 1\/100Photo 2: ISO 200, 300 mm, f\/7.1, 1\/500Photo 3: ISO 250, 130 mm, f\/5.6 1\/200","Date":"Reviewed in the United States on 13 September 2018","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"Verified","Title":null,"Review":"I\u2019m sure the product is fine, but the delivery person marked it as being handed to the resident.

This lens may not be one of the best like the pricier ones professionals or avid photographers may suggest but the clarity on this lens is really good, especially for the price and has the ability to take pretty decent macro photos at 200-300mm. I\u2019d suggest using this on manual focus only. IMO I think that\u2019s where this lens really works best. I\u2019m currently using this on a Canon M50 which is primarily the main reason I bought this specific one. Any other one would have overpowered my tiny camera.

We have a Canon EOS Rebel t6 (from a different seller) that was also purchased at the same time as this lens.We raise Pembroke Welsh Corgis and need to take pictures to promote our dogs and our 18 year old digital camera was not meeting our needs in picture quality or zoom capability.Corgis are short legged, but fast, so we needed the option of zooming in on them for pictures. This lens was well worth it and provides us much more flexibility in getting the pictures we need.Also living in wonderful rural setting, this lens allow us to zoom in on scenes that we would not otherwise be able to get as close to.This lens is well made and it is fulfilling our needs perfectly.","Date":"Reviewed in the United States on 24 January 2018","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"Verified","Title":null,"Review":"Got this lens to take on vacation to Colorado.

The first one was taken with my original lens (18-55 mm) when it was all the way zoomed in, while the second and third were taken with this lens. Huge difference! The colors are brighter, it focuses better, and the larger aperture makes a noticeable difference.As I said before, I'm new to photography so I wasn't really expecting much out of this lens. However, I think the average user would be very pleased with this, and for someone new to photography it would be a great investment to help them get started and gain confidence.-----Photo 1: ISO 100, 55 mm, f\/7.1, 1\/100Photo 2: ISO 200, 300 mm, f\/7.1, 1\/500Photo 3: ISO 250, 130 mm, f\/5.6 1\/200","Date":"Reviewed in the United States on 13 September 2018","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"Verified","Title":null,"Review":"I\u2019m sure the product is fine, but the delivery person marked it as being handed to the resident.

We have a Canon EOS Rebel t6 (from a different seller) that was also purchased at the same time as this lens.We raise Pembroke Welsh Corgis and need to take pictures to promote our dogs and our 18 year old digital camera was not meeting our needs in picture quality or zoom capability.Corgis are short legged, but fast, so we needed the option of zooming in on them for pictures. This lens was well worth it and provides us much more flexibility in getting the pictures we need.Also living in wonderful rural setting, this lens allow us to zoom in on scenes that we would not otherwise be able to get as close to.This lens is well made and it is fulfilling our needs perfectly.","Date":"Reviewed in the United States on 24 January 2018","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"Verified","Title":null,"Review":"Got this lens to take on vacation to Colorado.

Why in the hell isn't the US doing the same thing.  These covers are not cheap in cost, and in fact cost the same as my THULE case which is high end.  If we are expected to pay this much it should be made in the US and support our economy or be cheaper coming from China.  I hope this helps.

My old one had a clear plastic enclosure that scratched easily and cracked in several places due to poorly-designed stress points. Even though it was pricey in my opinion, I bought this because I liked the fact that it has a fabric texture that won't scratch.It takes a bit of figuring out to attach it (no installation instructions on the box or included inside). For the bottom, you have to slide the back on first so that the rear fin slips over the air vent. If you don't, it will never go on. Once installed, it is very secure and solid.Issues arose after having it on for a few days. My minor concern is that the fabric cover is going to become stained with skin oil from my fingers with no way to clean it. The major issue, and the main reason why I'm returning it is that the two clips that hold bottom piece in place ( positioned on either side of the track pad) are very sharp and scratched my forearms when I'm typing. For $75 (mind you that's minor when you consider that it's protecting a $4K investment), it should be smooth. At first I considered lightly sanding it, but worried that I may cause permanent damage.That said, I'm returning it for the InCase Dot which has a textured surface and one that I can wipe clean when necessary.","Date":"Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"Verified","Title":null,"Review":"Looks great east to fit..  a little loose sometimes, doesn\u2019t fall off but can slightly slip away but all in all very very hapoy","Date":"Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 May 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"Verified","Title":null,"Review":"Dopo anni di cover per iphone e ipad ho provato questa per macbook pro.

It is compact and lightweight, making it easy to carry around and perfect for on-the-go use. The speaker has a blue color variant that looks stylish and attractive.In terms of sound quality, the PTron Fusion Go does a commendable job. It delivers immersive  and well-balanced sound, with clear highs and decent bass. The 10W power output provides enough volume to fill a small to medium-sized room. I found that the sound quality remained consistent, even when the volume was turned up to higher levels.The battery life of the PTron Fusion Go is decent, providing up to 6 hours of playtime on a single charge. While this may not be the longest battery life compared to some other portable speakers, it is sufficient for most casual use. The speaker also has a built-in microphone, enabling hands-free calling functionality, which is a useful addition.Overall, the PTron Fusion Go 10W Portable Bluetooth Speaker offers a great combination of portability, sound quality, and connectivity options.

This works exactly as mentioned. App has nice features to remember the last setting even if the network disconnects or switched off. Only one thing people have to realise before buying is...even if you buy higher watts, RGB mode will have lower watts because of the wavelength and to produce the tint. So don't expect bright colours out of it. Instead you can use it along with good lamp deflectors to spread the light evenly inside the room to get the best out of it. Music sync is a useless feature simply to change the colours in loop. Doens't realy depends on music, regardless of any music it simply changes colour. All other features are proper including brightness adjustment.","Date":" 15 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Gives a very soothing effect to the room","Review":"Has soo many options of colors...My girlfriend loves it\ud83d\ude0d","Date":" 2 September 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"3.0","Title":"Stopped working in 9 months","Review":"The light was quite good for 9 months and then out of the blue stopped working.

The bulb is easy to set up and connect to my home Wi-Fi network. I am able to control the bulb using the Wipro Next smart app, which is user-friendly and easy to navigate.One of the features that I like the most is the ability to schedule and control the bulb remotely, which is very convenient when I'm away from home. The color and brightness of the bulb can also be adjusted to my liking, creating a more personalized experience.The 12.5 watt energy-efficient bulb provides a good amount of light and it's compatible with Amazon Alexa which makes it even more convenient.However, I have experienced some connectivity issues with the bulb, where it would sometimes disconnect from my Wi-Fi network and I had to manually reconnect it. This happened occasionally and it's not a deal breaker for me, but it's worth noting.Overall, the wipro b22d 12.5 watt Wi-Fi smart bulb is a good choice for those looking for a convenient and easy-to-use smart bulb. The compatibility with Alexa and Google assistant and the remote control feature make it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade their lighting setup. The connectivity issues I experienced were minor, but it's worth considering before making the purchase.","Date":" 14 January 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Buy it","Review":"This this my 6th wirpo bulb. 1st time i faced problem to connect but now i am used to this bulb and easy use. You can use these bulb in different colors and different patterns. This bulb can be operated by by alexa, Google assistant and wipro app. If you are playing music then it can change light as per music volume but you have to open music section of app and start. You can set commands to turn on and off at time by schedule or put timer for it. Brightness can be controlled. Brightness need to increase. When you bought it with alexa then it is value for money.

The replacement was atleast working","Review":"Ordered from seller ETrade Online. First bulb shipped was obviously used previously with usage marks (housefly waste dots on the lateral sides as well as taped packaging). The First bulb didnt even turn on. Second replacement was kinda better still showing usage marks but this one was working. I have integrated it with my Google nest mini (requires creation and linking Wipro account and initial setup with Wipro app) and have uninstalled the Wipro App now since I prefer not to keep useless clutter apps on my phone. Music functionality is a gimmick and started to get annoying. It doesnt resonate with your smart speaker like I was expecting. Rather pickup the audio from phone and then do the light show which obviously would cause off beat lighting cues. The Google assistant has a fixed set of colours for example: Warm white, Incandescent which give different shades of colours and enables brightness adjustments. I have not tested Routines rather have not needed it since installing. This being a second hand product I highly doubt its longevity but I can only have my fingers crossed and hope it lasts since given this price you really need to expect great things even if it is low compared to other options.","Date":" 22 May 2022","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"NICE I LIKE IT","Review":"NOT MUCH BRIGHT UNTIL ITS WHITE AND ALSO ASSISTANT SUCKSBUT IT HELPS LOT FOR LAZY GUYS EASY TO CONTROL","Date":" 4 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"3.0","Title":"Works great, but not working with Alexa","Review":"The bulb gets disconnected from alexa devices every time the bulb goes off and not touched for 8 hours.

Unfortunately, the product has not lived up to its advertised functionality, and I have encountered numerous issues with connectivity, rendering the bulb unreliable and frustrating to use.From the moment of installation, I have faced consistent difficulties in establishing and maintaining a stable connection between the smart bulb and the accompanying mobile application. Despite following the provided instructions meticulously, the bulb frequently disconnects from the app, making it impossible to control or customize its settings remotely as intended.Furthermore, the smart bulb's performance has been erratic, with frequent glitches and malfunctions. The bulb occasionally fails to respond to commands, experiences random flickering, and exhibits inconsistent brightness levels. These issues significantly diminish the overall usability and functionality of the product.Regrettably, my attempts to seek assistance through the warranty process have been met with disappointment. Despite the product being well within the warranty period, the brand has rejected my warranty claim, leaving me without any recourse for resolving these ongoing issues.I am deeply disappointed with both the product's subpar performance and the lack of support received from the brand. As a valued customer, I expected a reliable and functional smart bulb backed by responsive customer service.I kindly request that you reconsider the warranty claim for the defective smart bulb and provide a suitable resolution to address the connectivity and performance issues. I believe that as a reputable brand, it is your responsibility to stand behind your products and ensure customer satisfaction.I hope that we can resolve this matter promptly and amicably. I look forward to your prompt response and a satisfactory resolution to this issue.Thank you for your attention to this matter.","Date":" 15 June 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Wifi Connection problem","Review":"It is not connect smart phone through wifi and it is connect through separate wifi box .

Worst customer experience","Review":"I had bought this bulb and within few months it stopped working and this bulb has 1 year warranty so I contacted the Wipro team for resolution as the bulb stopped working while it was still under warranty. However, as you can see for the attached screenshots, deapite multiple follow ups over months, Wipro has not honoured the warranty terms and not provided me with a replacement or any other resolution. Instead, all they do is tell me that they have forwarded my complaint to concerned team but them neither give me contact details of their concerned team nor their concerned team ever responds or contacts me despite its been months since I lodged the complaint. Their customer service is the most pathetic that I have to ever deal with. You will spend your money and lose it if the bulb stops working and nothing will be down regarding it.

Tons of Customization.5. Super Bright in White tones (Warm to Cool white) comparable to other regular ~12.5W Cool White\/Regular White Bulbs.Cons:1. This is the biggest con I felt with this bulb (or all smart RGB bulbs). I wish there was just more brightness (in RGB mode). Any 5W Regular Cool White LED bulb can outshine it while RGB shades are selected in this bulb at 100% brightness. The bulb in RGB mode is not suitable for slightly large rooms or in rooms if there is some external light is still seeping.2. I wish the preset modes were a little better in terms of switching between the shades & stuff. Also, more shades should available in these presets.3. I wish the app do provided us with the energy consumption chart & like statistics.4. I wish instead of two different charts for colour selection - RGB shades & white shades, there was a single exhaustive option. Also, it would be better if there was an option to manually set the RGB values to get a precise shade as with fingers (touch input) the shade get off by a lot & its frustating to manually try to select that shade.","Date":" 26 November 2021","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Worth the money","Review":"The amount of money this product asks and the features it provides are in balance.","Date":" 7 February 2023","Sentiments":"Neutral"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Lights are good.

Even though you can manually change white\/colour modes per bulb, the tap-to-run automation is really messy. You can't set automation for colour, only the white mode gets activated, even though they give the option to select it, it automatically sets the color temperature for whites (cold white -> warm white). There's a whole bunch of options that aren't working on the app as well.

Well if you order it from Amazon or if you're ordering a Wipro item from Amazon: loose screws making sounds inside of the bulb.So, I had to pop open the plastic cover and first screw in those screws. Apart from all of that it's a great bulb. It's quite bright and remembers the previous state it was in after an electricity outage.Value for money: Well I don't think so it deserves to be priced this high considering all the elements that go into building this smart light bulb(also considering the fact that I had to screw in 2 screws before even using the bulb). But, what we do?If you're looking to buy a smart bulb for yourself I think Wipro provides you the cheapest one with all the features you can think a smart bulb should have.I have paired it with my morning alarm with this Wipro smart bulb so now when I have to get up in the morning instead of just 1 I have 2 things blinking and blaring at me.Go ahead buy yours...","Date":" 10 April 2021","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Awesome","Review":"Awesome gadget","Date":" 16 June 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udc4cBulb that offers bright shades of white and 16m colour combo options \ud83d\udca5","Review":"\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2714\ufe0fOverall product rating \ud83d\udd38\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\ud83d\udd38\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022Product description: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Received as describedBuild quality:  \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605ExcellentValue for money : \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 (bought it for 1155\u20b9)\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\ud83d\udcec INSIDE  THE BOX\u2192 A 12 w B 22 holder bulb\u2192 Useless Instruction Manual\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2795 The Goods\u2192Shades of white and 16m colour combination\u2192Alexa\/Google Assistant integration\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2796  The Bads\u2192Difficult to add in smart home\/Wipro app due to no clear cut instructions\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022First of all for to add\/reset the bulb switch on and switch off the device at least 5 times.\u2714\ufe0f Turn the switch in this cycle - On-off, on-off, on-off, on-off,on-ff, on\u2714\ufe0f Do not rely on Manual\u2714\ufe0f Do not rely on on-off pattern suggested by application.\u2714\ufe0fIf it binks slowly then its AP mode and if its blink fast then smart mode.\u2714\ufe0f\ud83d\udc49And I can bet more than 80~90% will opt-in for smart mode where the mobile broadcast the configuration.\u2714\ufe0f Still not connected repeat all the above-mentioned steps again.I opted this smart bulb as it has white light shades(awesome brightness) and 16 million colour combinations(less bright for 12w bulb) that no other manufacturer provides in single bulb at this price.

This budget-friendly television offers a fantastic viewing experience and a range of smart features that make it a worthwhile investment.First and foremost, the picture quality on this TV is remarkable. Despite being an HD Ready TV, the visuals are sharp, vibrant, and immersive. Whether I'm watching movies, TV shows, or playing video games, the display consistently delivers accurate colors and impressive contrast. The 32-inch size is perfect for smaller spaces and provides a comfortable viewing experience from various angles.One of the standout features of this OnePlus TV is its smart functionality. Powered by Android, it offers seamless integration with popular streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, and YouTube, allowing me to stream my favorite content with ease. The user interface is intuitive and responsive, making navigation a breeze. Additionally, the TV comes with built-in Chromecast support, enabling effortless screen mirroring from my smartphone or tablet.The audio quality of this TV is surprisingly good as well. The speakers deliver clear and well-balanced sound, providing an immersive audio experience. However, for those seeking a more cinematic experience, I would recommend connecting external speakers or a soundbar for enhanced audio performance.In terms of connectivity, the OnePlus 32Y1 offers multiple options. It has three HDMI ports, two USB ports, and an Ethernet port, allowing me to connect various devices such as gaming consoles, set-top boxes, and external storage devices. The Wi-Fi connectivity is reliable, ensuring smooth streaming and quick access to online content.The design of the OnePlus 32Y1 is sleek and modern, with thin bezels that maximize the screen real estate. The build quality feels sturdy, and the TV blends well with any decor. The remote control is simple and functional, offering easy access to all the TV's features.While this TV is packed with impressive features, there are a few minor drawbacks worth mentioning. Firstly, the TV's resolution is limited to HD Ready, which means it doesn't offer full HD or 4K capabilities. However, considering the price point, this is a reasonable compromise. Secondly, the viewing angles could be slightly better, as there is a noticeable loss of color and contrast when viewed from extreme angles.Overall, the OnePlus 80 cm (32 inches) Y Series HD Ready LED Smart Android TV 32Y1 is an excellent option for those on a budget who still want a feature-packed and reliable smart TV. It offers impressive picture quality, seamless smart functionality, and a sleek design. Despite a few minor limitations, it delivers great value for money. I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone in search of an affordable yet capable smart TV.","Date":" 26 May 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Colour","Review":"Light and colorful, great song quality","Date":" 27 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"3.0","Title":"Remote is not working properly","Review":"Remote Google assistant not working only just two weeks in working then not working TV performance is screencast very bad then where is slow performance","Date":" 6 September 2023","Sentiments":"Negative"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Best TV In Best Price....","Review":"Best quality t.v in best price.... amazing thing that my child is more comfortable with voice command and less effective on eyes..","Date":" 31 August 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"3.0","Title":"working good, but some time after slow process,","Review":"quality good but use some time after . slow process","Date":" 3 September 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Superb","Review":"No doubtOne plus is a great","Date":" 14 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Value for money","Review":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Using the Smart TV for almost a year now still no issues detected infact works quite smooth and the volume is loud enough looking at it size and price brightness could have been better and also sometimes it lags a little but overall  its good apart for that the tv built quality is good the stand for the tv is not provided in the box but you can buy it from the installation guy to mount it on the wall its around 300 rs but i had a croma tv and the tv fell on the ground because of poor wall mount quality provided by company and had to buy new tv this stand is solid and is fixed need to open screws to remove the tv which is a good thing for a wall mounted ( Added featuretv works with alexa )","Date":" 26 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"3.0","Title":"Not such features","Review":"Basic features for Andriod only, no other special features like music mode etc...","Date":" 4 September 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Nicely working","Review":"Good picture quality nicely working..","Date":" 9 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Good","Review":"Good","Date":" 18 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Good","Review":"Amazing but back is little bit thicker compare to new models that's why this is outside from the wall","Date":" 13 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Hagahhs","Review":"Kilep nahi hai to fix kyshe karn ga","Date":" 7 September 2023","Sentiments":"Neutral"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Good","Review":"Good proformance, picture quality is excellent.","Date":" 10 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"4.0","Title":"Nice tv budget tv","Review":"The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Very nice tv","Date":" 23 July 2023","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"3.0","Title":"Just brand value similar quality has another cheaper brands","Review":"If you think it will have better quality then cheaper brands no it's same and the most worst you cannot cast your mobile screen on the tv you can only hear audio no visual connection","Date":" 15 August 2023","Sentiments":"Negative"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Great product","Review":"Value for money tv.

dedicated to this TV.Also you need a WiFi router for getting full functionality.Let me start with the pros1. Picture quality is great. You'll need some Tweeks though. Set it on movie preset for day time use. Energy saving for night time use. I reduced backlight to 20 and it's in user mode to reduce eye strain.2. Audio quality is good. You also need a lot of Tweeks though.Set it in movie preset if you're watching movies. This preset let's you hear all the music details also you'll hear the dialogues crystal clear. In this mode you won't hear bass that much. You'll get a hint of base nothing much. Because base will affect the Dialogues.Set it in music preset if you're listening to music in this preset you'll hear all the highs and lows crystal clear. You'll get bass as well.Okay now discuss about the consEverything else in this TV is a con.It has data saver installed but you can't able to access it. Data savers has an update in playstore. For some reason it's not updating.You can't use this TV as a Bluetooth speaker. You have to cast your phone screen in order to play your music on TV screen.Which brings a lot of problems. First you need a WiFi router with 2 GB data dedicated to this TV for casting only. Because it's using Chromecast not miracast. So what happens is, you are sharing your mobile screen to your TV using mobile data even though it's on same network. Which is stupid. Why in the world I have to spend my data to transfer the data packets using my router. It's on same network for god's sake.Also while casting if you open YouTube in your phone it opens YouTube app on tv, so you'll end up spending 3X data for playing YouTube video. ( For playing in mobile, for transferring data to tv and for the video playing on TV). But fellow competitors like mi TV also have built in Chromecast only. I don't know any budget TV which supports miracast, if you knew comment below to let me know.It can only access hard disc upto 2tb.Some apps like Udemy are not supported on this TV.You're going to spend more money on ott, let me explain how.. if you're going to use Netflix on TV you'll need premium subscription to add 2-4 devices at a time. Also if you have Airtel xstreme on your phone, and thinking I can use Airtel xstreme on tv.. you're wrong.. you need to purchase xstreme for TV as well.If you're rich enough to purchase all ott platforms and have enough money to spend 4gb \/ day data on TV on regular basis, you'll love this TV.Otherwise you're gonna end up hating this TV and yourself for purchasing this TV.I chose to purchase this TV because it's an Android TV, also home services during warranty period is free. I don't have to take this TV to the service centre, if there's something's wrong. After warranty period they charge \u20b9450 for the service. Which is cheaper than other brand.But if I knew I'm gonna get this for \u20b916k I wouldn't even think about purchasing this TV. Because I got these picture and audio in my old Sansui LCD tv. Which lasted 5 years without any issues.","Date":" 17 February 2021","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Good TV, installation service was good too","Review":"Haven\u2019t used the TV much, but it looks great, works fine!

I got this @14999. It is definitely worth the money. I am reviewing this product after using it for 10 days. One thing that really annoyed me is that I got this for 14999 and a week after the price dropped to 13999. I know it's not a big deal but 1000 rupees is a big amount and I could have saved it.I will mention some pros and cons of product below and this might help you to make up your mind before you decide to purchase the product.Positive points:1. Picture Quality - The picture quality is superb at this price range.. It looks great, the colours are very bright and the contrast ratio of TV is also very good. The viewing angles on TV are also nice. I have uploaded a video regarding it, you can check it out.2. Smart cum Android TV - This is not just a Smart TV but it is an Android TV. This means you can install and sideload any apps you like as per your liking. I sideloaded a couple of apps and they all worked in first attempt. Earlier I was looking to go for Samsung and LG but both those TV in this price range only offers smart TV features and you can't side load apps in a Smart TV. That's why Android TV is best.3. Attractive Looks - One of the main reason why I bought One plus TV was because of the reason how good it looks. It almost looks like a bezel less display because the bezels on TV are super thin and sleek. The TV surely looks very attractive and it this price range you won't find many TV's as good looking as this.4. Operating system - The OS provided by one plus along with this TV is very smooth and it looks very clean and runs smooth most of the times. You might notice a little bit of lag while opening heavy application but it is hardly noticeable. In this price you can't really ask for much as TV only comes with 1GB of ram and despite that TV runs pretty smooth.5. Connectivity - Connectivity is smooth and fluid. I connected my Xbox controller to play some games via Steamlink and my Bluetooth controller was detected as soon I plugged it in. WiFi also connects within 5 seconds of booting the TV. The boot time of TV is also decent enough and only takes 15-20 seconds for TV to boot.Negative Points:1. Sound - The sound quality of the TV is fine. It is nothing special and not bad either. The sound quality is little above average. I think it could have been a little better.2. Price - Price drop pissed me off \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. I mean come on I paid 1000 extra and one week later the price dropped, that's unfair. The TV is worth at 15k too but it could have been a classic deal if I got this at 14k! \ud83d\ude023. Mirror Cast - Mirror casting from phone has a lot of delay even though I have a very fast network.All in all this TV is really good and I loved it.Important Info - You will be charged 299 rupees at time of installation of TV if you want to get the TV mounted on wall. The installation will be done at time of delivery and will be done by same people who deliver the TV. The delivery person will call you and inform you regarding the same. For 32 inches they will charge 299 and for above 32 inches you will be charged 399. My installation went very smooth and at first TV was not mounted properly so I requested person to put that in perfect position and he gladly did that for me. Overall I am satisfied with both the product and installation.","Date":" 14 December 2020","Sentiments":"Positive"},{"Rating":"5.0","Title":"Smart TV","Review":"Of course, here is a review for the OnePlus 80 cm (32 inches) Y Series HD Ready LED Smart Android TV 32Y1 (Black) that you can post on Amazon:I recently purchased the OnePlus 80 cm (32 inches) Y Series HD Ready LED Smart Android TV 32Y1 and I must say that I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.

The TV runs on the Android operating system, which gives me access to all of my favorite apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and YouTube.

(Pardon repetitions, if any.) GC200 received promptly.","Review":"Pointers:1.Check seller ratings before making the purchase.2.If you own a CRT television, you'll need to purchase an RCA cable separately as Dish Tv offers only HDMi cable for free. It may cost you around 300 bucks.3.Installation will be completed within 24-48 hours of purchase.4.You'll also receive a call from Dish TV post ordering. You may ask all your queries if you find the rep up to the mark. In rare cases, the representatives are lousy and have poor process knowledge. In such case, disconnect and call back.5. One meter is approximately 3.2 feet. Unless you lack the arrangement to install the dish in your home balcony, 10 meters of wire is generally sufficient, and it's free of cost.*Detailed review of the seller and Dish TVAfter going through the plethora of reviews, I finally decided to go with DTHservices as they had good seller ratings, and rightfully so. There response was amazing. My mails regarding general queries were promptly returned. I'm greatly satisfied with their service. I usually don't order from third party sellers(non prime).Regarding Dish Tv as a brand:I've come across various negative reviews for their poor customer service and their after sales service. I, however, faced no inconvenience with their support. After placing the order, I received a call from their end. The representative was polite and professional, and made necessary enquiries and assured me that installation will be done within 24 hours. Also, she satisfactorily addressed all my queries too. However, the experience may vary depending on the process knowledge of the representative you're talking to. Some executives lack the required finesse which affects user experience. But certainly most negative reviews are generally exaggerated. I've spoken to many Dish Tv reps and they are not bad.Next, I received a call from a local technician. He arrived at about 6 in the evening. Installation was done within 30 minutes. However, I was surprised and suspicious when the total cable length approximated to 25 meters. There's one floor between the rooftop and my apartment. I checked the reading on the wire and it showed 25 meters of usage. Since, first 10 meter of cable wire is free, I paid 180 bucks for the remainder (15 x Rs12), post which the technician politely requested for a tip. I was reluctant but since I'm terrible at saying no, I acquiesced and gave him 70 bucks more.In all, my total expenditure was Rs.1740 of which  I'm expecting Rs. 200 to be refunded through GC as promised.My installation was done on a CRT television which required an RCA cable, which I didn't have. I was told it'd cost 300 bucks. As I was going to have an LED tv installed within two days, I decided against buying it.We checked everything and it was good to go. I got a platinum pack of Rs. 750 free for the first month as promised. Then the technician offered me their RCA cable for use without charging extra until I got my LED installed which delighted me greatly. This also played a role in my having decided to tip him. Overall the technician seemed able and honest.Regarding the picture quality:Generally speaking, I'm not really fastidious about it. I've a full HD television now and I'm perfectly fine with what dishtv has to offer. I've been at my cousin's who has subscribed to Tatasky and a friend who uses Airtel Dish Tv. I personally don't see any glaring difference in the HD quality that those brands offer.As long as Dishtv offers reasonable packages, I'll not regret this purchase.Place of order: Hyderabad","Date":" 21 April 2018","Sentiments":"Positive"}
